the format of parameter.txt is this:
t {start timestamp} {end timestamp} <--- at the start of each partition
{detnum} {detname} {fwhm} {fwhm_err} {eff} {eff_err} {exposure} {E_shift} {E_shift_err} {bkgname} {sysname}
the format of events.txt is this:
{detname} {timestamp} {energy} {bkgname}

Identifiers for the tool to know which bkg and systematic unc values to
use. The systematic uncertainty fit parameters are shared between
detectors with the same sys name. This means that all detectors under one
sys name share the same pull terms for energy shift, FWHM and efficiency.
I am aware that this is a bit questionable, but I guess this shouldn't
have a large contribution to the likelihood at the moment anyways.

You can see the separation as described here in the bgkname in the
parameter.txt. In addition, what is not mentioned in this text, is, that
the icpc and ppc in module 2 are also separated.
